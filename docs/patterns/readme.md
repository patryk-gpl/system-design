The patterns collected here are based on the classic book `Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software` that provides a comprehensive overview of 23 different design patterns. The patterns are implemented in Python. The mentioned book is organized into three sections: creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. The creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The structural patterns deal with object composition, trying to identify simple ways to realize relationships between different objects. The behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects, trying to identify the patterns of communication between objects.
